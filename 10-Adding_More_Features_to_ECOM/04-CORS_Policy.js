/* 
    CORS : CORS Stand for Cross Origin Resource Sharing .This Means When We Run the Server
        on a PORT if we Our Client Which Runs UI on Different PORT and if that 
        Client sends request to the Server then that Client Not Able to fetch the
        data and an error is Occur. This is the CORS Policy Which Means Cross 
        Origin Requests means origin of both Client and Server is Different.
        
    FIX the CORS Policy Error : 
    We Can Config the In our Server and Allow Different Origin Client to Access
    and fetch the data from the server. This is All We Can done by Config the
    server file for the Client So that we can able to fetch the API data from
    different Origin(here Origin Stands for the Port which we Can Use to Run the
    Server and as well as when We use Live server that can also use the port of
    the system )
