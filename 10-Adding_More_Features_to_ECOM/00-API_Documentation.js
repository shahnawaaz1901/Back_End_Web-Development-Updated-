/*
    When Ever We Create an API we might not Know who is Our Client and What
    Data Client sends to the server.

    For This type of Issue We Need to Create an API Documentation Tool Which 
    Helps the Client to UnderStand How our API is Work and What Kind of Data
    we Expect from the Client. How Client Can Call the API and Which Data our
    API is sent.
    
    We can use OPEN API tool Which Provides a standardized means to defne Your
    API to Others.

    with API Documentation we Can Quickly UnderStand how API Works, configure the
    infrastructure, generate client codes and test cases for the API. All the
    Feature is Part of Documentation.

    'SWAGGER' is tool to Implement the All of the Specification of API 

    When We Book an Appointment for Covid Vaccine we can Book Appointment for 
    Vaccination from Many Apps like paytm, arogyasetu but how can we Book appointment 
    for Vaccination this all can done by the API which government of India provides
    for All Online platforms. That API is Helps us to book appointment for covid
    vaccination from Multiple Platforms.
    
    When we Search for Cowin Vaccination API in we get multple things like an API
    key and how can we use that api in our application to implement the appointment
    feature in Our Applcation. And What Kind of Request API expect from the user.

    With API Documentation of Covid Vaccination, Government Provide All Details what
    they expect from the client and also provide the response for every request
    status of response for every request. All the things goverment provide so that
    if Anyone want to use that api in application can be Implement by UnderStand
    that API with the Help of the Documentation

What is the Purpose of API Documentations ..?

1. To help clients understand the inner workings of an API.
2. To provide a standardized means of defining APIs for servers.        //* Correct
3. To ensure the API is secure and immune to cyber-attacks.
4. To generate client code automatically.
