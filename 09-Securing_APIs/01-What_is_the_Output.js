Authentication and Authorization

What is the primary difference between authentication and authorization in the context of 
user access control?

1. Authentication ensures the integrity of user data, while authorization determines user 
    permissions.
2. Authentication verifies the identity of a user, while authorization controls the user's              //* Correct
    access to resources.
3. Authentication ensures secure transmission of user credentials, while authorization 
    encrypts user data.
4. Authentication establishes a secure connection between the user and the server, while 
    authorization manages user session timeouts.

Solution Description : Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, 
                ensuring that the user is who they claim to be. It involves validating user 
                credentials, such as usernames and passwords. On the other hand, authorization 
                determines the permissions and privileges that a verified user has once their 
                identity has been established. It controls the user's access to specific resources, 
                functionalities, or data within the system.
