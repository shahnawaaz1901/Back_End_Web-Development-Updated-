/*
    We can add More Features in Our E-Com Application But While Adding the
    New Feature we need More Better Tools because for adding every feature
    we do more number of calls to the databases do more transactions to 
    database. So we need more better tools to Enhance Our Application Such
    as Like "Mongoose". Mongoose is an "ODM" tool. ODM Stands for "Object 
    Document Mapping Tool" . Another Similar word is ORM "Object Relational 
    Mapping", But ORM Tools Use for Relational Databases. Because we use
    NoSQL Databases we have ODM such as Mongoose. Mongoose is Most Popular
    ODM Tool for MongoDB.

/*
    Benefits of Mongoose :
    1. ODM : Purpose of ODM is to Provide Better and Easy Interaction to the
        Database. Currently We Use the Default node.js package of mongodb but
        when we use mongoose it provides better transactions calls in easier
        format

    2. Better Structure : Mongoose Provides Better Structure Like Schemas. We
        Know that in NoSQL Databases We Dont need any kind of schemas but in
        some cases we need schemas for give the Structure the to the Database

    3. Validations : Before Storing the Data in Database we are Not Validate the
        Data because because we dont have any option but using the mongoose we
        have middlewares for validation before storing the data 

    4. More Controls using middlewares : Because we have middlewares so that we
        have more controls 

    5. RICH API : RICH API is provided by Mongoose ODM which enhance the API Calls
        while working on Real world Major Applications

    //*Mongoose Not Replace the mongodb but enhance interaction with Database
