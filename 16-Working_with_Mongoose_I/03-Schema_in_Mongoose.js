    Schema in Mongoose : Everything in mongoose starts with a Schema. Each schema maps to a 
                MongoDB Collection and defines the shape of Documents within that Collection. 
                In Simple Word we can say schema is Like a blueprint shape of the data. We 
                Already use blueprint of Data known as model, schema is very similar with 
                models. But schema is Not type of class which we use to create models in Our 
                Node.js Application.
                We Can say Mongoose Gives a structure to the collection means its define the 
                shape that how our document Looks like in the collection
    
    In the Schema we have schemaType. SchemaTypes nothing but we can say a data type of the 
    attribute in the document. Attribute is the fields which we define while creating a Schema.
    
    SchemaTypes : 
    1. String
    2. Number
    3. Date
    4. Buffer
    5. Boolean
    6. Mixed
    7. ObjectId
    8. Array
    9. Decimal128
    10. Map
    11. Schema
    12. UUID
    13. Bight

    Schema Not Just gives the structure to the database but Also very powerful tool which 
    forces fields to gives the actual data and validate the fields and its types. So that 
    we can validate our document before storing into the database
