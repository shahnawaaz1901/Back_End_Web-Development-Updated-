/*
Repository Purpose

What is the responsibility of the repository module in a Node.js application .?


1. To abstract the data access code and centralize it.                      //* Correct
2. To integrate third-party APIs more seamlessly.
3. To transform raw data into different formats.
4. To set environment variables for the application.

Solution Description : The repository module in a Node.js application is primarily 
                designed to server as an abstraction layer over the data access code. 
                This means that instead of having database-related code scattered 
                throughout the application, it is centralized within the repository.
