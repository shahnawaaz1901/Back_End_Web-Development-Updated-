/* 
    In Real World Application Our Server and Our Database has two Different 
    Application because Our Server Code is on Like on Cloud Like AWS and Our
    Database is MongoDB so we need to Connect both with each other to work
    NodeJs application with Database.
    
    We Install MongoDB like a server so we Need to Connect NodeJs to that server
    In this case Node.Js behaves Like a Client and MongoDB behave likes a server
    to that Client. We Install MongoDB server on Our Computer But thats not Complete
    the Connection for Connect Both we Need to install MongoDB inside the our Node.JS
    Application like a packages so that we use that package to connect mongoDB server
    With Our Node.JS application We can also called that package as driver of MongoDB
    
    as We Mention that our NodeJs Application works like a Client and that package
    or we can say driver helps us to Connect to MongoDB server
