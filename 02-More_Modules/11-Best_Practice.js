    To Enhance Quality of Code We Need to remember some steps in mind :
    
    1. Modularize Your Code : When Ever You Write the code always write code into different modules 
                    so that each module is independent and each module only handle a certain task
                    for different task Create different Module because our code is more readable
                    and we can easily able to debug our code and if one module creates a bug then
                    because other module is independent other modules not affected
    
    2. Use Descriptive Naming Convensions : When Ever You Creates a Variable, functions or class 
                    while making an application always gives name as per the working of that 
                    function, variable and class.
                    This Gives you and edge because if someone read your code you that person
                    not need to checks the whole function if your function name gives an idea
                    that hey this function do this task. So Naming Convension is Very Important
                    and we Need to take this Seriously.
        
        <---
            A developer write a Program Which Computer Understand But a Good Developer Write a Program
            Which Human Can UnderStand
        --->
    
    3. Keep Module Responsibilities Clear : This Means one Module perform only that certain task
                    Means One Module Only Created for Doing One task if You Take More Responsibilities
                    to one Module then Readability of Module is Not Good and if SomeOne Other can
                    check your code that person stuck at the point of time and able to understand.

        <---
            If You Change in Module and more then 1 Module is Affected for changes in perticular module
            then this Indicated the bad Practices because Other Module is Affected After Changes in a
            perticular Module. 
            For Changing in Module Only One Reason have to change the module more then One reason
            also indicates bad Practices
        --->
    4. Use Version Control Like Git : Always Push Your Code into the Version Control System Like Git,
                    Replit and other Version Control System. WithOut Version Controll System working 
                    in a Team is A Night mare because how can other developer knows that what changes
                    is done by whose.

Best Practices

Which of the following is/are best practice(s) for writing maintainable code in Node.js? ( Multiple )

1. Clear and descriptive naming conventions for variables, functions, and modules       // Correct
2. Minimal comments and no README files
3. README file for each module, explaining functionality and usage                      // Correct
4. Version control like Git for tracking code changes                                   // Correct

Solution Description : To write maintainable code in Node.js, use clear and descriptive names 
                    for variables, functions, and modules, create a README file for each module 
                    to explain its usage, and use version control like Git to track code changes 
                    and collaborate with other developers. Minimal comments and no README files are 
                    not recommended as they make it harder for others to understand and maintain the code.
