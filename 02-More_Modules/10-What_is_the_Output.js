Event-Driven Architecture

How does Event-Driven Architecture improve the scalability of Node.js applications?

1. By allowing the application to handle multiple tasks concurrently and        // Correct
    asynchronously
2. By reducing the number of tasks that the application can handle at a 
    given time
3. By decoupling the components of the application, making them more independent    // Correct
    and scalable
4. By making the application dependent on a single thread for all tasks

Solution Description : Event-Driven Architecture improves scalability by allowing concurrent 
                    and asynchronous task handling and promotes loose coupling between application 
                    components, making them more independent and scalable to adapt to changing requirements.
