/* 
    In Relational Databases in a Database we have different datasets or tables this 
    and in every table we have rows and columns row have a data of a person but in
    NoSQL Database Table is know as collection and every data of row is known as document
    A collection is collection of documents.

    In NoSQL Database every database can have different collections and every collection
    is the Collection of multiple Documents .
    
    In today scenario we cant say that applications relay on single database because 
    we cant predict that what kind of data user can sent also we can't say that every
    application uses NoSQL Databases because in some scenario application requires fix
    data like in case of user credentials application requires fix email phone number and
    password and this things can't be modified so we can say in todays scenario both NoSQL
    and Relational databases is used by the Companies which has huge data of users
