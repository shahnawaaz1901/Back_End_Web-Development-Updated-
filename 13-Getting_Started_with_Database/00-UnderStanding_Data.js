    What is Data : Data can be file, image or anything which provide some 
                Information to us.
    
    Right Now in Our E Commerce Application If We want to store some data on
    our server that data is destroyed when we restart the server. Only data
    which is inside the model is available to us. For Storing data we need
    to use persistent storage right now we use in memory storage that's why
    our data destroyed when we restart the server.
    
    Importance of Data : Application withOut Data is useless because if some
                Web Application or Android Application Not Probide any kind
                of Data then No Person use that application
    
    In Our E Com API Application We store Data Product, Cart, rate that Data
    is Helps us to track our Information regarding ecom API. User Credentials
    also a data which is Most Important and We Also Need to Store User Creden
    tials after the encryption so that it provides more security and safety

    Our File System is Also is Persistent Storage but question is all big brand
    stores their data into the file system we can say yes but all brand not use 
    file system directly but use indirectly through the databases. Because in 
    File System it's hard to manage the data update the data through file system
    that's why all brands uses databases to store the data. Database uses file
    system to store data but database provides us more convinient way to store 
    or manipulate the data and Managing Data in Database is easy through the
    Database. Using Persistent storage if our server is restart all the Data which
    we store while running the server is not destroyed.

    File System Not Allows Us to store data in convenient way that's why we use
    databases and Data Related Operation CRUD in file system is hard to do but
    in the databases it provides convenience to do All Operations.

    We Can UnderStand databases as tool because using databases gives us data as 
    per requirements means data which is required for the user is sent by the data
    bases.
