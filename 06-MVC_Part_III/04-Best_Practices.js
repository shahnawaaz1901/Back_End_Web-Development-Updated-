 ?1. Sepration of Concerns : Seprate Data, Handler and View in Model, View and Controller. 
 !Do not Load Controller for Multiple Responsibilities
 ?2. DRY : Dont Repeat YourSelf means Try to ReUsed Some Code as Possible
 ?3. Using Middlewares : It DepCouples or Reduce Complexities from Controller
 ?4. Modularize : Seprate Your Entire Application into chunks or Sepration File
 ?5. Naming Conventions : Try to Give Name as Per work of functions, variables or Modules(if Internally Created)

Best practices for MVC Applications

Which of the following are best practices for Model-View-Controller (MVC) 
applications?

1. Combining models, views, and controllers into a single 
    class for simplicity.
2. Breaking the application into smaller, reusable modules.             //*Correct
3. Avoiding the use of middleware functions for request 
    processing.
4. Implementing security measures, such as using secure                 //*Correct
    communication protocols and validating user input.

Solution Description : Breaking the application into smaller, reusable modules 
                improves maintainability. Implementing security measures, such 
                as secure communication protocols and input validation, protects 
                the application. Combining models, views, and controllers into a 
                single class leads to code complexity while avoiding middleware 
                functions limits functionality and common task handling.
