Solution Description : Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on 
            the user's browser. They have a longer lifespan compared to sessions, 
            as they can be set with expiration dates. While cookies are commonly 
            used for tracking user behavior on websites, they serve various other 
            purposes beyond authentication. For example, they store user preferences 
            and enable personalized experiences.
