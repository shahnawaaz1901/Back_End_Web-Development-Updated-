    Why Task Runners : Because for every major application we need to 
        perform same task like minifying CSS and other all. All we can
        do manually but its very painful to write same thing again and
        again so it takes lot of times, so instead of doing all work
        manually we use task runners which can handle all of this work
        automatically by its plugins.  

    GRUNT : GRUNT is JavaScript Task Runner. In One word We can specify
        Task Runner as Automation of things. Where Less work you have to
        do when performing Repitative task such as minification of css, 
        image compression , compilation and unit testing of the task

    Why GRUNT : The Grunt ecosystem is huge and its growing everyday. With
        Literally hundreds of plugins to choose from, you can use Grunt to
        automate just about anything with minimum of efforts
