    Gulp : Gulp is another pipeline which have multiple plugins. Gulp is a 
        toolkit to automate & enhance workflow Leverage gulp and the flexiblity 
        of javascript to auomate slow repitative workflows and compose them 
        into efficient build pipelines.

    Mainly Work of Gulp is on the javascript to minifying the javascript code
    but this is not mean we can only just compress or reduce the javascript 
    code but we can also do same thing which we can do using the grunt, but
    grunt is another task runner which provide us plugins to automate the work
    same as grunt.

    Here we use gulp for comressing the size of images and optimize the size of
    images

/*
    Difference and Similarities Between Gulp and Grunt :

    Gulp and Grunt both are task runners and both provides many plugins to automate
    repitative things, But way we configure the task is different in both task runners
    because Grunt works on JSON Objects to configure tasks where Gulp works on more
    JavaScript function such as callbacks to do the same kind of things.
    Both do same work but in different way of Configuration
