    Web Development : Development of Web Application which a Web Application Which Usually 
                Consists Client and Server.

/*  
    Main Purpose of Express (A Web Development FrameWork) :
    1. To Create Modern Web Applications            :- Modern Applications : Data Intensive Applications Like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram etc.
    2. Create High Performance Web Applications     :- High Performance : Solve Multiple Queries in Less Time
    3. Create Scalable Applications                 :- Scalable : Ability To Handle Large Users as per Requirements

/*
    For Creating a Web Applications We Also Need Understanding of Patterns Along With 
    Framework to Create a Better Web Application. In Current Market Lots of Web Development
    Pattern is Exist, But We Learn Most Three Most Popular Patterns :
    1. MVC (Model View Controller) : MVC is One of The Most Popular Web Development Pattern in Market. 
            MVC Works on Seperation of Concerns Principle. Meaning Of Seperation of Concerns is It 
            Divide Web Development Task into Three Components Models, View and Controller.

            Model : Job of Model is To Represent Your Data From Database.
            View : Job of View is To Represent the Different HTML Pages as Per Client Requirements
            Controller : Job of Controller is to Handle Different Kind of Request.
    
    2. REST APIs : REST Stands For Repsentational State Transform Protocol. Which Helps to Provide
            Cross Platform Support for Client and Server. MeanWhile if You Create Server Using 
            Node.js and express.js using REST API Architecture then One Server handles All Request
            of Smartphones, Desktop and some Other Kind of Platform Like Android TV etc.
    
    3. Micro Services : In Microservices Architecture All Services is Divide into Different Parts.
            Each Part Have Their Own DataBase, let's suppose one server responsible for authentication
            of user that server also have their seprate database which only stores account related information
            and Some Server Which Responsible for Content which also have thier seprate database for
            content. Like this A Huge Web Applications Devide into seprate Parts and can be manage Easily.            
            MicroServices Distribute Application into Different Machines, So that it is More Scalable and
            more high performance. But MicroService Architecture is Complex Compare to Other Two Architecture
            In this Architecture Copy of Server Also Exist Which Devide Load of One Server into Two Parts

Microservices Architecture

What is/are the purpose(s) of the Microservices architecture?

1. It breaks down the application into smaller, independent services that               // Correct
    communicate with each other.
2. It increases scalability and maintainability.                                        // Correct
3. It combines all application services into one big service.
4. It shares a single database for all services, to ensure seamless integration.

Solution Description : The Microservices architecture approach avoids combining all services 
                into one large service, which can lead to complexity and create a single point 
                of failure. The purpose of the Microservices architecture is to structure the 
                application into small, independent modules. 
                This enables easier scalability and maintenance without affecting other parts 
                of the application.
