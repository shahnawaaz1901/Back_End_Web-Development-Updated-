/*
    Layout : For Using Some Same Content on Multiple Pages Like Header and Footer 
        it's very painful to write that content again and again for fixing this kind
        of Problem we Can use Layout Package. Layout Package Allows us Instead of Writing
        Common Content Like Header and Footer Store header and Footer in Seprate File
        and then When ever we Required Header and Footer just Write One Line and Include
        Header and Footer in that File.

    Layout Works as MiddleWare.
