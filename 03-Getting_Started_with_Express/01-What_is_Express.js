/*
    In this Module We will See a Node.Js FrameWork which is Express
*/

/*
    FrameWork : A Framework is helps Developers to Create Application in Less Time, Because
            a framework has lot of inbuilt features, inbuilt libraries which developer can
            use directly and make Application in Less time with More Efficiently
*/

/*
    Almost Every Programming Language have their Framework.
    Some FrameWork of Popular Programming Language :

    Language                    FrameWork
    1. Python                   Django
    2. Java                     Springboot
    3. C-Sharp                  .net

    Like Other Programming Language Node.Js has Express framework which Allows User to Create 
    Application in Less time

    Why Express Comes into The Picture, Because Express Solve Many Problems which was faced by 
    Many Developers While Creating an Application using NodeJS. 
    
    Some Major Problems Which Express Solves : 
    1. Routing : Express Gives us inbuilt functions or you can say modules which helps us 
            to manage the different url or requests. and In some Request a subRequest URL
            is Required by the Client Which can easily Manage through Routing in Express
    2. MiddleWare : When Ever User send Request to the server and server send that request 
            to the request handler in between we can modify our request using middleware.
            middleware have access to read or write request which server sent to request
            handler.
    3. Template Engine : When Ever User Sends request to the server and server gives the html
            content to the user, that html content is static and same for all user instead of
            sending same response and make static webpage we can send different responses to
            the different users using template engine and make our web page dynamic.
            Multiple Template Engines is Exist.

    Express.Js is framework which is built on Node.JS for Understand express we need to 
    understand Node.Js first and for Node.Js we Need to understand javascript because files
    are stores in javascript format.

Introduction to Express

Which statement(s) is/are true regarding Express? ( Multiple )

1. Express simplifies the process of creating server-side applications by handling          // Correct
    much of the boilerplate and repetitive tasks.
2. Express is a web framework for Node.js.                                                  // Correct
3. Express provides a lightweight layer of essential features on top of Node.js.            // Correct
4. Express is a complete replacement for Node.js.

Solution Description : Express is a web application framework built on top of Node.js. While Express
                    simplifies the process of building web applications with Node.js, it cannot be 
                    considered a complete replacement for Node.js.
