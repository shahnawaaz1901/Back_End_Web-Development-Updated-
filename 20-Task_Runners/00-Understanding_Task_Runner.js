    Whenever We Are Creating web applications, other then writing program
    we need to perform certain operations which we need to perform which
    is : 

    1. Minifying CSS : When Ever we work on major project sometimes we created 
            multiple CSS file like 100s of CSS files. This ammount of CSS file
            can affect to Performance of the server and as well as browser where
            we load the our web application. So For Low latency and high performance
            we need to compress the CSS files by removing spaces in CSS and 
            overlape the Common Classes and Other Things.
        
    2. Convert SASS to CSS format : SASS(Syntatically Awsome Style Sheet) 
            converts into the CSS because SASS is the another form CSS to 
            style the WebPage. This Helps us to Load All SASS files into 
            webpage at the same time when CSS is loaded

    3. Compressing Images : When Ever We Uploaded some image or file on social 
            media Application Size of the File is Reduced because low size file 
            can load quickly and it is easy to handle by the server compare to 
            actual size of file which ammount of size is anything 

    4. Running test Cases : Run the test cases on the Application to findOut the
            bugs because in some cases one user is faced bugs but another user
            not faces that bug so its a developer responsibility to run their
            application on every device or smartphone.

    5. Deploying Applications : Deployement is the part where we are going to 
            live our web applications, because we want that our application not 
            limited in our Computer our application can be accessed from anywhere 
            and every where because we also cant run our application if our system 
            is off.

    Above All task is Done by the task Runner which is tool to handle this things
*/

/*
    For Task Runners we need to Do some work which is :
    1. Configurations
    2. Libraries and Plugins
