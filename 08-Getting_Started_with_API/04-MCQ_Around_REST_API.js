RESTful APIs

What is one of the key characteristics of RESTful APIs?

1. They store client information in sessions for improved security.
2. They are built upon a stateful architecture, ensuring efficient communication.
3. They allow for seamless integration with various platforms                   //*Correct
4. They primarily focus on rendering views and controlling the UI.

Solution Description : The correct statement is C. One of the primary 
                attributes of RESTful APIs is their capability to enable 
                seamless integration with diverse platforms and systems. 
                RESTful APIs enjoy extensive support across various types 
                of platforms, facilitating smoother communication between 
                servers and clients.

REST API and scalability

How does REST API contribute to the scalability of applications?

1. By tightly coupling the backend API with the client for efficient scaling.
2. By replicating databases across multiple servers.
3. By relying on session-based architecture to handle increasing user requests.
4. By being loosely coupled and independent of clients, facilitating easy scaling.      //*Correct

Solution Description : The correct answer is D. REST APIs contribute to the 
                    scalability of applications by being loosely coupled and 
                    independent of clients. This means that the backend API 
                    can be scaled independently without affecting the clients. 
                    It becomes easier to replicate servers or add more resources 
                    to handle increased traffic since the server does not store 
                    client-specific information.

HTTP methods used in REST APIs

Which statement(s) correctly describe(s) the functions of HTTP methods 
used in REST APIs? (Multiple)

1. GET method is used to modify an existing resource, and 
    POST method is used to fetch details of a resource.
2. POST method is used to fetch details of a resource, and 
    PUT method is used to delete a resource.
3. GET method is used to fetch details of a resource,                   //*Correct
    POST method is used to create a new resource.
4. PUT method is used to update a resource, and                         //*Correct
    DELETE method is used to remove a resource.

Solution Description : Statements C and D are correct as they accurately describe 
                the functionalities of RESTful methods. GET retrieves information 
                about a resource, POST creates new resources, PUT modifies existing 
                resources, and DELETE removes them.
