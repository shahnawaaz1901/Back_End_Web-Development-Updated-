1. By implementing an authentication and authorization system.              //*Correct
2. By creating a separate file storage system for sensitive files.
3. Utilize role-based user management, granting editing permissions         //*Correct
    only to team members assigned specific roles or responsibilities.
4. Implement regular data backups and version control to mitigate the 
    risk of unauthorized modifications.

Solution Description : By implementing an authentication and authorization system 
                with role-based access control. Role-based user management grants 
                specific editing permissions to team members based on their roles 
                or responsibilities, limiting access to sensitive project files and 
                ensuring authorized collaboration within the project management tool.
