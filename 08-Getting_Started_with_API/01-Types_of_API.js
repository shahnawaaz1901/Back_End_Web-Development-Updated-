/*
    Three Types of API is Exist : 
    1. SOAP API
    2. REST API
    3. GRAPH-QL
*/

/*
    1. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) : SOAP is the OLDEST Method of API to
                                Retreive the Data from the Server to Client. SOAP
                            is Currently Rarely Used Because it's Very OLD and 
                        Approx nothing used with the Node.JS. SOAP is Used to 
                    Handle API Request of the Client but the Biggest Problem with
                the SOAP is it's very heavy and it's bulky to Transfer Data to the
            Client. Due to HeavyNess SOAP is Very Slow also and it's Very Complex
        to UnderStand Compare to REST API Because REST API is Very Simplified.

    
    2. REST API : REST API is the Most Popular Way to Communicate Between Client
            and the Server. REST API is the Most Widely Used and Widely Supported
            Across the Web. 
    

    3. GRAPH-QL : Graph-QL is the new technology and it's get more popularity in
            less time. GraphQL tried to Reduce the Load while Communication b/w
        Client and the Server. GraphQL tried to get data from the Server which
        is necessory to Client. GraphQL not Transfer unNecessory data or Info
        that's Why it's Reduce the Loaded and Graph QL is Also Very Fast.
