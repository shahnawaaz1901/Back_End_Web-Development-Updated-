Socket.io Advantages

What are some advantages of using Socket.io over traditional HTTP requests for 
real-time communication .?( Multiple )

1. Lower latency for real-time updates                          //* Correct
2. Scalability for handling a large number of clients           //* Correct
3. Increased complexity of the program
4. Efficient bidirectional communication                        //* Correct

Solution Description : The option "Increased complexity of the program" is not 
            typically considered an advantage of using Socket.io but can something 
            be a drawback, depending on the specific use case and the complexity of 
            the implementation.
