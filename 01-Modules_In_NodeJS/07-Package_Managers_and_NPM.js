    Default Package Manager for Node.Js is NPM (Unofficial Name Node Package Manager)
    NPM not Only Manage NodeJS Packages but also manages angular and react framework
    packages so you can't say that NPM is Specifically Built for Node.JS

    Other Package Manager is YARN.

    Why NPM is default package Manager Because NPM is Automatically Install when You
    Install NodeJS on Your System.

    For Verify NPM install or Not you can check by npm -v
