/*
    While Building an application where you need to store some Files on server
    (a simple file on server).
    For this we need to use the module of fs(file system).
    Node.Js provide many ways to use file system
    1. Blocking Code                    ( Using Un-Nessesory While Loop )
    2. Non Blocking Code                ( Using setTimeout or interval function )

/*
    Woking with File System is Input/Output Operation, Because :
    1. File System is Managed by Host Operating System.
    2. Programming Language have to depend upon Operating System for Access
