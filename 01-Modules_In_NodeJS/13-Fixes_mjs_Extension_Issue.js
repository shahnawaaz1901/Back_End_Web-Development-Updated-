/*
    For Fixing the issue of Extension when use ES6 Module of JavaScript
    We need to do some changes in package.json file
    in package.json we have an attribut called type if we set type to module
    then we able to use ES6 Modules in js and if we set type to commonjs then
    we use all commonjs module in js, which we would not requried because we 
    already use commonjs modules in js
    You can check in Fix_MJS_Extension_Issue_in_ES6 Folder which Contains all modules 
    and package.json file
