Popularity of Node.js

What are the contributing factors to the popularity of Node.js? ( Multiple )

1. Node.js utilizes JavaScript, a language familiar to many developers.                 // Correct
2. Node.js is optimized for scalability and high performance.                           // Correct
3. Node.js implements an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, enabling                 // Correct
    efficient and speedy data handling.
4. Node.js implements a synchronous I/O model that offers predictable and reliable data handling.

Solution Description : Option 4 is incorrect as node.js utilizes an event-driven, 
                non-blocking I/O model, which allows for concurrent handling of multiple 
                requests without blocking the execution flow.
