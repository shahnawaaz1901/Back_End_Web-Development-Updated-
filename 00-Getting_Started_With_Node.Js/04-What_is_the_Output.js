Runtimes

Which of the following role(s) does Node.js play as a runtime? (Multiple)

1. Memory management                                // Correct
2. Handling input/output operations                 // Correct
3. Garbage collection                               // Correct
4. Database management                              

Solution Description : Node.js does not play a role in database management directly. 
                While it's possible to interact with databases (like MySQL, MongoDB, etc.) 
                using Node.js via appropriate packages, Node.js itself is not responsible 
                for the management of these databases. That is handled by the specific 
                database software itself.
