    Node.Js : Node.Js is Not Programming Language framework library, Node.Js is An 
            Open Source Cross Platform ServerSide Runtime for JavaScript.

            Node.Js is Server side tool We Not Use Node.Js for FrontEnd.

            Every Programming Has Runtime to run To use the Language JavaScript Also
            has it's RunTime, For FrontEnd Browser Acts Like Runtime for JavaScript 
            Which Helps you to create front end application.

            Like FrontEnd JavaScript Has RunTime to Run On Server Side that's Node.Js

            For JavaScript You Can Use Browser as Runtime for Front End or Client Side 
            and Node.Js as Runtime for Server Side.
    
    OpenSource : Open Source Means which is Available to EveryOne Which Code is 
                Available for All

/*
    Why Node.Js :
    There Are Many Technologies to handle Server Side , But Why Node.Js is Popular Because
    Node.Js Give Something Extra :
    1. Handles Asynchronous Operations Better
    2. Faster Then Existing Tools in Many Use Cases

/*
    How Node.Js is Created :
    We Learn that Browser Like Google Chrome and Node.Js is Runtime for JavaScript 
    for Client Side and Sever Side Respectively.
    Google Chrome Uses JavaScript Engine V8, Which is Open Source.
    As We Know Google Chrome is The Fastest Browser Because is Uses V8 Engine of 
    JavaScript. V8 Engine Very Well Optimized to Run JavaScript on Front End.

    Ryan Dahi Some Change in V8 Engine using C++ and Create a Runtime for JavaScript 
    on Server Side which is Node.Js.
    C++ not Prequist to Learn Node.Js
